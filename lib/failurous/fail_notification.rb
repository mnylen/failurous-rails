    # If the section does not exists, it will be created. Otherwise the field is added to the section.
    # If the field already exists inside the section, it will be overriden.

    # _field_options_ can contain any options for fields supported by Failurous. At least the following
    # are supported:
    # * _:use_in_checksum_ - *true* if the field should be used when combining fails, defaults to *false*
    # * _:humanize_field_name_ - *true* if the field name should be humanized, defaults to *true*
    # For a full list of supported field options, please see the API documentation for Failurous.
    #
    # Placement of the field inside section can be controller with _placement_. If no placement options
    # are given, the field will be appended to the end of the section. Supported options are:
    # * _:below_ - the field should be placed below the specified field (e.g. *:below* => *:type*)
    # * _:above_ - the field should be placed above the specified field (e.g. *:after* => *:message*)
    # You can use _:first_ and _:last_ to place the field below or above the first or last field in the section.
    # Currently combining _:below_ and _:above_ is not supported.
